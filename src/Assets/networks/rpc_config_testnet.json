Since he discovered his passion for 3D art and motion design he has developed his own distinct style. Tries to stay humble and anonymous. Works often influenced by the events from his personal life or day-to-day reflections about the world around him.",
            "description":  "This 6 piece collection was created with an intention to admire certain elements important to the creative process, but also life in general. The aim of every one of these six artworks is to make the new owner just take a small break and ponder about one of those topics, as well as admire their influence on the surrounding world. I chose the form factor of a surreal museum-like space, because ever since I was a small child, I thought about modern art galleries as the calm, quiet places designed to let the observer admire and reflect upon the odd, non-conventional and often controversial concepts. I hope that events taking place in this little space I designed in my head will succeed in their goal.",

The Club owns, maintains and races horses with profits being shared by the community. All of the club's efforts are most importantly focused on providing a long and sustainable post-racing life for all horses. A large portion of all project proceeds will directly fund equine rescue and retirement, ensuring great lives for these beautiful animals.",

Growing up I self-taught to become an equestrian rider. I have also judged equestrian events and competitions and organized charity festivals in support of children with disabilities. \n\nRiding horses can be very healing for children and their psycho-emotional state and for those who become more involved, assists with muscle development. I used to coach children for free but have retired from this. However, I keep in close contact with the equestrian club in my hometown and occasionally still assist by running the group classes for children. I also financially support and support them with media coverage, assisting with fund raising to help kids receive this amazing and free therapy with horses.\n\nTo support the equestrian club and children, I am auctioning a limited-edition 1:1 ‘Rare Heart Hodler’ NFT. It also comes with a T-shirt and an autographed card from myself. Additionally, 10 holders of the 'Heart Hodler' from the open edition will be randomly selected to receive a physical autographed card from myself",

            "description": "Hello everyone, \n\nI have always had a passion for art which most already know, but what most don’t know is that I am very fond of equestrian sports. Growing up I self-taught to become an equestrian rider. I have also judged equestrian events and competitions and organized charity festivals in support of children with disabilities. \n\nRiding horses can be very healing for children and their psycho-emotional state and for those who become more involved, assists with muscle development. I used to coach children for free but have retired from this. However, I keep in close contact with the equestrian club in my hometown and occasionally still assist by running the group classes for children. I also financially support and support them with media coverage, assisting with fund raising to help kids receive this amazing and free therapy with horses.\n\nTo support the equestrian club and children, I am auctioning a limited-edition 1:1 ‘Rare Heart Hodler’ NFT. It also comes with a T-shirt and an autographed card from myself. Additionally, 10 holders of the 'Heart Hodler' from the open edition will be randomly selected to receive a physical autographed card from myself",
